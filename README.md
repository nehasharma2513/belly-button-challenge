## Creating Interactive Dashboard using d3 and Plotly

In this project, we are building an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity](https://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

This interactive dashboard includes :

    ### 1. Horizontal bar chart : Bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual
    ### 2. Bubble chart : Chart which displays each sample with:
                        1. otu_ids for the x values and for marker colors
                        2. sample_values for the y values and for the marker size
                        3. otu_labels for the text values
    ### 3. Displaying sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information
